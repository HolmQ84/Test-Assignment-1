2 - TWO KATAS

Complete the following two katas using TDD. 

Make sure to follow the TDD mantra, “red-green-refactor”:
• Red: Write a failing test.
• Green: Write the smallest implementation to make your test pass.
• Refactor: Make the necessary refactoring to the implementation and tests, 
  in order to remove code redundancy

A fuller explanation of the TDD steps can be found here: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development

Remember, the point of these katas is not to solve the coding tasks as such. The point is to use TDD. 
Thus, if your code contains a solution to the task, but no tests, the solution is not accepted.

2.1 FAHRENHEIT-TO-CELCIUS CONVERTER

Use TDD to create a fahrenheit-to-celcius converter.
Use TDD to extend it to a celcius-to-fahrenheit converter.

2.2 ROMAN NUMERAL KATA

Implement an “Arabic numeral to roman numeral” converter using TDD. Follow the
standard form of roman numerals – the rules can be found on the wikipedia page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals#Standard_form.
You can test your converter against this online converter:
